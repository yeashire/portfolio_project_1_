### Bugs
+ ##### Solved bugs
   
    * I had problems with the services page images section, the images were not responsive on screens below 1200px. 
     The solution was to add a new class and style by using display: flex;
    Flex-wrap: wrap; flex-direction: column;
    * I had to add an extra media query for the main section of the page in order for the gap between the image and the quote to decrease on mobile devices. The solution was to switch the height from 1200px to 850 px.
    * The Services page was loading too long.
    The solution for that was to resize images.
            
    ---
+ ##### Unsolved bugs
    - None.
+ ##### Mistakes
    * I didn't fully grasp the idea of commits, they were not descriptive enough, I was to focus on HTML and CSS and forgot to add some of them.
    However, I realised where I made a mistake and will avoid it in the new project.
